# 🚀 Overview

**PrivLend** is a privacy-preserving decentralized lending protocol built on **Aleo**.

It enables borrowers and lenders to interact without exposing:

- Loan amount  
- Collateral value  
- Credit tier  
- Financial position  

All sensitive data remains encrypted and verified via **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

Only essential metadata is stored publicly.
